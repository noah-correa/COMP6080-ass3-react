# Testing Approach
- Component Testing:
  - Simple Components tested
  - First check main children component(s) are found
  - Then check properties
  - Then check functionality - e.g. functions being called correct number of times
- UI Testing:
  - Find components by id
  - Then simulate interactions
  - Check for correct functionality
